## 🧠 Problem Statement
Create a backend API for managing To-Do tasks with CRUD operations and persistent JSON storage.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- fs-extra for file operations  
- CORS & Body-Parser for requests  

## ⚙️ Features
- Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks  
- Persistent data using JSON file  
- Filter tasks by status  
- Easy to test with Postman  

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
npm install
npm start

Then open `http://localhost:3000/tasks` in your browser or Postman.

## 🧪 Example Endpoints
